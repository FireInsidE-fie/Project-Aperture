          Welcome! Here you will find (almost) all relevant information you will ever need
          about me, FireInsidE, known as Aisling Fontaine, or, more professionally, as Etan Stettler.<br><br>

          Based in Switzerland, I am a 17 years old student in economics that loves to learn new things.
          Some of my current interests include web programming, pixel art and streaming! I love to adapt
          to new themes, environments and more! I specifically enjoy learning anything about computers, 
          as they have passionned me since I was little.

          I love learning new things, so whenever I encounter something new that sounds exciting to me,
