        <p>
          Welcome! Here you will find (almost) all relevant information about me, 
          FireInsidE or Aisling Fontaine.<br><br>

          Based in Switzerland, I am a 17 years old student in economics that loves to learn new things.
          Some of my current interests include web programming, pixel art and streaming! I love to adapt
          to new themes, environments and more, but I specifically enjoy learning anything about computers, 
          as they have passionned me since I was little.<br><br>

          I am willing to carve myself a path into the freelance world, mainly in web development! I have
          also found a big interest into making games using the Unity game engine, and am currently exploring
          that other possibility as well! My mind isn't made up yet, so I'm currently doing both on my free time,
          as my economics studies sadly take most of my time almost every working day.
        </p>

        <h2>My skills</h2>
        <p>
          I love learning new things, so whenever I encounter something new that sounds exciting to me,
          I might add it here!<br>
          You will also find my public projects down below!
        </p>

        <details id="front-end">
          <summary>Front-end web development</summary>
          <p>
            I am able to make a simple website 
            (in fact, this was entirely created by yours truly!) using <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>, 
            as well as some <em>JavaScript</em> (check out the links in the top right of this web page)!
          </p>
          <br>

          <strong>Projects :</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This website : 
              I made this entire website from head to toe! It may not look like much for now (lots of
              black and white) but I have got big projects for the future of this website. There will
              be many different things here, ranging from this professional section to mini-games, 
              a more personal section closed off to most people (might learn some security while I'm
              at it) and more!
            </li>
          </ul>

            I can navigate the Unity interface and understand some of 
            the basic functions of the engine.<br>
            I can implement player controls and basic physics. 
          </p>
          <br>

          <strong>Projects :</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>Slurp :</strong>
              A very unoriginal game where you control a ball rolling down an infinite slope. The ball
              goes faster and faster as the game progresses, and you need to evade obstacles as you roll!

              This is heavily inspired from the <a target="_blank" href="https://slopegame.online/">Slope</a> web game also using Unity.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Learning prototypes :</strong>
              You can find an archive containing all of my prototype unity projects so far <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12U8mPM0MHXO76x2BjoFjs6jFg3Ckm62H/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.<br>
              Disclaimer : NO visual assets (3d models, animation, etc...) for these prototypes were created by me. All of them
              were provided by Unity through their Unity Learn learning program.

            I know some basics of using the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> programming language.
