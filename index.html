        <p>
          Welcome! Here you will find (almost) all relevant information about me, 
          FireInsidE or Aisling Fontaine.<br><br>

          Based in Switzerland, I am a 17 years old student that loves to learn new things.
          Some of my current interests include cybersecurity, music and writing! I love to adapt
          to new themes, environments and more, but I specifically enjoy learning anything about computers, 
          as they have passionned me since I was little.<br><br>

          I am willing to carve myself a path into the cybersecurity space, maybe as a freelancer. I recently
          started writing again, and am working on building my very own multimedia universe based on stories,
          animation films and more! Many different areas interest me, so I am constantly trying new things
          out to see which might become my future work! 
        </p>

        <h2>My skills</h2>
        <p>
          I love learning new things, so whenever I encounter something new that sounds exciting to me,
          I might add it here!<br>
          You will also find my public projects down below!
        </p>

          <summary>Front-end web development</summary>
          <p>
            I am able to make a simple website 
            (in fact, this was entirely created by yours truly!) using <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>, 
            as well as some <em>JavaScript</em> (check out the links in the top right of this web page)!
          </p>

              <strong>This website :</strong> 
              I made this entire website from head to toe! It may not look like much for now (lots of
              black and white) but I have got big projects for the future of this website. There will
              be many different things here, ranging from this professional section to mini-games, 
              a more personal section closed off to most people (might learn some security while I'm
              at it) and more!
            </li>
          </ul>

          <summary>Cybersecurity</summary>
          <p>
            I recently started learning cybersecurity using HackTheBox, an online learning platform that
            allows me to perfect my theory and practical skills by attacking virtual targets and finding
            their vulnerabilities. I will keep working to enhance my skills in this area to potentially
            make it my future job.
